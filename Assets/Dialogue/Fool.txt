What's green and has wheels? Grass! I lied about the wheels. Get it? Town fool here.

So what do you do?
I’m the town fool, pretty obvious isn’t it. I want to make everyone laugh and just have a good time
How hard is it to be the fool
It’s hard I’ll tell you. The crowds are fickle and can turn on you quicker than rain on a cloudy day. But the smile of each person makes it worth it
What’s your favorite joke.
What's the difference between a Farmer and a Fool. One tells jokes, the other breaks yolks! ….Well I like it.

Jokes about apples tomorrow get a huge laugh.
I knew it! Everyone loves the apple jokes they just weren't ready for em.
Whatcha think I just fell off the apple tree (get it). But seriously, everyone knows apple jokes in this town are worse than a yeti appearance, what are you on about?
A big group of travelers will come through tomorrow.
Ahhhhhhh yeaaa. Alright fool, you've prepared for this, go set up by the town square and knock em dead. Not literally like last time though.
Come on buddy, don't you go pulling the two faced wool over my eyes, I know no one's set to visit for a while now.
The village head will come to your act tomorrow.
oh God oh God, I better get ready. I need batons, fire, slingshot, two cows, an old crows nest, seven sheep, a small misshapen orange, a bundle of straw…
Nice try buddy, but I'm always watching-er-looking out for the head to come so don't think you can slip one by me you slipper byer!
