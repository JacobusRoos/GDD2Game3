Hello there dearie, I'm the farmer's wife. How are you?
S
So you're the farmer's wife
That's right dearie, we've been married for longer than I can count
What do you for the farming?
I tend to the livestock while the farmer is out in the field. I help gather the crops and prep them for the market and then I go sell them in the market.
That sounds like a lot of hard work.
Oh of course it is, but me and my husband decided long ago that this was what we loved to do

The rice in the village will be on sale
That sounds lovely, I've been meaning to make rice pudding for awhile.
Why rice be on sale now dearie, it's not in season? Lovely joke but let's be serious
It will be a good day for harvesting tomorrow
Ah wonderful, I've been meaning to harvest the watermelon for days now.
Looks like it'll rain tomorrow, so I think I'll stay inside. I'm not sure about these “predictions” dearie.
Tomorrow there will be no market.
Sounds like a good day to stay home and cook. Thanks for the heads up
Sounds off dearie. The have markets everyday why would today be different?

Oh my a yeti here? I’ll have to tell the farmer and we’ll leave as soon as we can.
Come now child, no yetis have been seen here in forever. You must get over this habit of lying.
