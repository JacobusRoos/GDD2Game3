May the lord be with you son. I'm the father of this town
S
Are you on the only priest in the area?
Yes. There aren't too many people, so it's not difficult to help them all
What do you do?
Lead everyone in prayer, offer my advices in the ways of god, and give sermons to those who will listen
What's your best piece of advice.
Love others the way you love yourself and be granted happiness forever.
P
There will be many people gathered in the town center tomorrow
I've been planning a big sermon for a couple days now, this sounds like an excellent day to give it!
I have a lot to do tomorrow, and I'm sorry but your claim sounds dubious.
A miracle will happen tomorrow in town
I always thank the lord for the little gifts he gives, i'll be sure to alert the others
The lord works in mysterious ways, and usually not so....announced in advanced. Where did you hear this information?
Many people will want spiritual advice tomorrow.
I'll have to start preparing then. Thank you, it's nice to get a head start for once
When the people need advice they will come to me. I can't waste my time on strange sounding claims of days not yet here

Oh dear a yeti! I must help the people get out, they will be scared, but I will reassure them!
A yeti? They would not dare approach this town. They fear the word of god most of all.
