Halt, who goes there. We can't just have people running around the town unaccounted for
S
Who are you?
I'm the guard of this town, charged with stopping thieves and ruffians from making a stay here
Is it hard to protect the town?
Well, it's not easy. The normal kind of filth that rolls in is easy enough to deal with, but there's always the threat of a bandit raid.
What's the worst thing that happened in this town
The worst thing would be the yeti that came down all those years ago and almost destroyed the whole village, we were barely able to fight it off. Luckily there hasn't been a yeti sighting in years
How good are you with that sword?
Ha. In the academy I was the best sword in the whole barracks. So you best keep your head about you.

There will be a thief by the farm tomorrow
Well, it has been a bit too quiet for my tastes. I'll stake out the farm tomorrow just in case
Oh yea sure they'll be there "tomorrow". Sounds like a load of crap meant to distract me from the real threat.
Tomorrow will be a slow day for newcomers
Ah lovely, I've been wanting to take some time off to polish up my sword and clean around the house.
Sounds like a plot to get me to go home tomorrow. Sorry but justice never sleeps and neither do I, well except at night
A sword seller will be in town tomorrow
Excellent, I've been looking for a long sword with a longer grip, the old one is too short
Come on now, i've seen the roads, and there's no one there for days. I can't go chasing mystery sword sellers.

A Yeti is coming tomorrow.
Oh my lord, the yeti is coming? here?! I have to fight it off... wait no I can't. I have to protect the villagers as they evacuate.
What are you kidding me, a yeti here? Do I have to take you somewhere so you won't bother anyone.
