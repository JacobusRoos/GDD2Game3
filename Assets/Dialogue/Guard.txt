Halt, who goes there. We can't just have people running around the town unacounted for
S
Who are you?
I'm the guard of this town, charged with stopping thieves and ruffians from making a stay here
Is it hard to protect the town?
Well, it's not easy. The normal kind of filth that rolls in is easy enough to deal with, but there's always the threat of a bandit raid.
What's the worst thing that happened in this town
The worst thing would be the yeti that came down all those years ago and almost destroyed the whole village, we were barely able to fight it off. Luckily there hasn't been a yeti sighting in years
How good are you with that sword?
Ha. In the academy I was the best sword in the whole baracks. So you best keep your head about you.

There will be a thief by the farm tommorow
Well, it has been a bit to quiet for my tastes. I'll stake out the farm tommorow just in case
Oh yea sure they'll be there "tommorow". Sounds like a load of crap meant to distract me from the real threat.
Tommorow will be a slow day for newcomers
Ah lovely, I've been wanting to take some time off to polish up my sword and clean around the house.
Sounds like a plot to get me to go home tommorow. Sorry but justice never sleeps and neither do I, well except at night
