Who are you?
I'm the farmer around these parts, growing crops to sell and animals.
What kind of crops do you raise
potatoes, corn, carrots, cabbage, and a little squash
What kind of animals do you keep.
Cows and pigs, some chickens, a couple sheep, and my trust dog fred.
Is it just you on the farm.
No, my lovely wife is with me, she does work in the house while i'm out in the field.

It will rain tomorrow
Oh, there will?  I’ll be sure to bring inside the animals to keep them out of the rain.
Are you sure about that? I haven’t seen any clouds at all today and none of the animals are acting like it will rain.
It will be sunny tomorrow
Excellent! Good to hear that we will have good weather tomorrow!
I saw some clouds on the horizon today. Are you sure that it won’t rain tomorrow?
The cows will give a lot of milk tomorrow
Fantastic, I'll be able to free up time on sunday for the chickens
Now hold on, I've milked cows every sunday all my life, I don't see a reason to change now

Oh god! I’ll be sure to be on the look-out for it.  Thank you for the warning.
Hahaha! That’s funny! Everyone knows that the yeti’s haven’t been seen in years though.
